You can see the app running in your own language by providing me translations.

For that purpose, you can add your changes to [this](https://github.com/alexmercerind/harmonoid/blob/master/lib/language/language.dart) file on the repository.
You can translate this, even if you have little to no knowledge of Dart.

## 📖 Workings

Majority of functioning & logical code in this app, is [here](https://github.com/alexmercerind/harmonoid/tree/master/lib/scripts) in the repository.

For downloading music, a dedicated server is necessary which you can see [here](https://github.com/harmonoid/harmonoid-service). It is managed by me, [@raitonoberu](https://github.com/raitonoberu) & [@mytja](https://github.com/mytja).
