## 📎 Information

👋 Hello Everyone! As of November 6, 2020, I as the maintainer & main developer of project, has decided to rewrite this project & start from scratch, because current version of app has few issues in its core & code is less managable. Newer version of app (i.e. v3.0.0) will be a completely new app, with a lot more new features & control over your music. The project is alive & you can see the progress in the [development](https://github.com/alexmercerind/harmonoid/tree/development) branch of this repository. You can join Discord server of Harmonoid with above button, to get an early look at upcoming features and provide feedback or you may just talk to us about anything you want & chill. Thanks a lot for your love 💙!


## ✅ Features

- 🎵 **Powerful Library Management**
  - Music automatically gets arranged into albums, artists & tracks.
 
- 📱 **Play Local Music**
  - Play music already saved on your device.

- 💾 **Free Music Download**
  - Download the music of your choice for free.

- ✨ **Stunning User Interface**
  - Every element on screen beautifully animated giving a sense of motion & very strictly follows [material.io](https://material.io) guidelines. 

- 💜 **Ads Free Forever**
  - No advertisements! I have literally no profit associated with this project, I'll appreciate if you ⭐ drop a star.

- 🎹 **Lyrics**
  - Fetch lyrics for your saved or downloaded music.
  
- 📑 **Playlists**
  - Make your own playlists & play your favorite music on the go.

You can see the app running in your own language by providing me translations.

For that purpose, you can add your changes to [this](https://github.com/alexmercerind/harmonoid/blob/master/lib/language/language.dart) file on the repository.
You can translate this, even if you have little to no knowledge of Dart.

## 📖 Workings

Majority of functioning code in app is [here](https://github.com/alexmercerind/harmonoid/tree/master/lib/scripts) in the repository.

For downloading music, a dedicated server is necessary which you can see [here](https://github.com/harmonoid/harmonoid-service). It is managed by me, [@raitonoberu](https://github.com/raitonoberu) & [@mytja](https://github.com/mytja).
