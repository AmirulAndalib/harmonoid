/// CollectionRefresh
/// -----------------
///
/// This [ChangeNotifier] acts as a listener to [Collection] when [Collection.index] or [Collection.refresh] is called.
/// It calls [ChangeNotifier.notifyListeners] periodically while music is being indexed, whose interval time is given by
/// [kCollectionRedrawRefractoryPeriod]. Thus, it avoids re-building UI unnecessarily very quickly.
///
/// Thus it results in following advantages than listening to [Collection] directly at the time of refreshing or indexing:
/// * It keeps music [Collection] usable for the user even when it is being indexed.
/// * Indexing music & calling [ChangeNotifier.notifyListeners] in [Collection] over every iteration causes too many UI rebuilds
///   which ultimately causes [Collection] to be not visible at all to the user until it is completely indexed.
/// * It allows to show the indexing progress wherever needed in the UI.
///
