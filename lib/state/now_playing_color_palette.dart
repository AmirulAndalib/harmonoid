/// NowPlayingColorPalette
/// ----------------------
///
/// This class globally keeps & provides the [Color]s extracted from a [Track] which is currenly playing.
/// Managing [Color]s this way has two benefits:
/// * No need to run `package:palette_generator` redundantly everywhere we need to access the palette.
///   `package:palette_generator` runs on main thread & causes substantial frame drop every time a palette is extracted.
/// * This avoids race condition that caused palette of previous [Track] to be still visible even after new [Track]
///   started playing.
///   Since, palette generation is `async` operation previous song's palette could be calculated faster than the next one, somehow resulting in the overlap.
///
