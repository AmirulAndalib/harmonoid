/// StorageRetriever
/// ----------------
///
/// This class is used to retrieve absolute storage paths for internal storage & SD card on Android.
///
/// This is the only solution.
///
/// By default, [getExternalFilesDirs] returns the application specific & private path e.g.
/// `/storage/emulated/0/Android/data/com.alexmercerind.harmonoid/files`.
///
/// This is because Android is promoting Scoped Storage & [MediaStore], which unfortunately
/// fail many of our use cases like custom or multiple directory selection for music indexing
/// or looking for .LRC files in the same directory as audio file etc.
///
/// This would also mean that all the application (in-theory) would have to be additionally
/// written in Kotlin just to support Android, because existing media library manager &
/// indexer written in Dart is completely file-system based, since Windows & Linux have no
/// such concepts as Android recently redundantly introduced.
///
