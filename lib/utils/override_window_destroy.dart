/// ---------------------
///
/// Overrides the `delete-event` signal of Flutter's GTK window on Linux.
/// A constantly running instance of `libmpv` causes `Segmentation Fault`
/// upon attempting to close the window.
///
/// Calling [OverrideWindowDestroy.initialize] ensures that all instances of
/// `libmpv` are properly disposed & then the same is notified to native side
/// of the source code, which then launches another thread to send `destroy`
/// signal to the window.
